"""
Locust performance testing file for E-commerce Promotion Buy Tracker API.

This file simulates realistic traffic patterns for an e-commerce promotion campaign
that tracks customer purchases and provides analytics for promotion effectiveness.

Endpoints tested:
- POST /buy: Log customer purchases on promotional pages
- GET /stats: Get promotion analytics and buy metrics  
- GET /health: Health check endpoint

User Types:
- CustomerUser: Simulates customers making purchases (high volume)
- AdminUser: Simulates admins monitoring campaign performance (low volume)

Usage:
    locust --host=http://localhost:8080
